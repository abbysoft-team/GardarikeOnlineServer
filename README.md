# GardarikeOnline server
Gardarike Online is a new MMO strategy and rpg game. Currently it is in early stage of development. We have 2 developers working on the project, one at server side and one making frontend. What we want to achieve is to make gameplay unique but consistent between multiple platforms such as mobile devices and PC's. If you play on your mobile device, the game will be more like strategy economic building simulator. But once you switch platform to PC you will be able to enjoy plain old MMORPG genre expirience.
